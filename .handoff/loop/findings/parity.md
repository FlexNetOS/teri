# Parity Verdict Trail

Audit record proving no-downgrade across the MiroFish → teri port.
Append-only: each dated block is a witnessed verdict from the parity gate.

---

## 2026-06-14 · U-015 · `GraphBuilderService` (Zep graph-build) → `KnowledgeGraph::build()`

**Verdict: PASS** (map-onto-substrate, behavioral-equivalence verified) — with **one tracked `- [!]` follow-up** (chunking, owned by U-013, not a U-015 downgrade).

**Type:** map-onto-substrate. Source X delegates to Zep Cloud (external SaaS, not runnable here), so this is behavioral-equivalence of the mapped petgraph extraction path, not a literal Zep diff. Each SOURCE branch behavior was read from `graph_builder.py` + `file_parser.py` (not assumed) and compared to the Rust `build()` at `src/graph/mod.rs:237`.

**Baseline / no-downgrade:** full `cargo test` = **156 passed, 2 ignored** — exactly the TRUE current baseline (the DISCOVER "142 on c894de8" was false-green; c894de8 was a non-compiling bad merge). No regression.

### Per-branch differential (source behavior → Rust behavior)

| Branch | SOURCE (MiroFish) behavior — evidence | Rust `build()` behavior — evidence | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| Happy path | Zep resolves entities + edges from episodes; `_get_graph_info` reports node/edge counts. Contract: "Alice/Acme/NY" + rel set → 3 ent + 2 rel, Alice→Acme edge | 3-ent contract: `test_entity_extraction_with_mock_llm` (3 ent); 2-rel: `test_relation_extraction_with_mock_llm`; full pipeline `test_build_from_seed_document` (2 ent/1 rel, `neighbors[0]=="Acme Corp"`) + `test_graph_construction_with_mock_llm` (Alice.neighbors=[Bob]) | **PASS** |
| Empty extraction | `_wait_for_episodes` `if not episode_uuids: return` (graph_builder.py:354); `split_text_into_chunks` returns `[]` for empty/whitespace (file_parser.py) → completes, NOT an error | `if graph.entity_count()==0 { return Ok(graph) }` (mod.rs:254) — valid empty graph | **PASS** `test_build_empty_extraction_tolerates` |
| Duplicate entity | Zep entity-resolution merges same-name nodes; no fault | `if !graph.index.contains_key(&entity.name)` guards add (mod.rs:248); first-wins, no abort | **PASS** `test_build_duplicate_entity_is_skipped` (1 ent, kind=Person) |
| Unknown-entity relation | Zep only edges resolved nodes; dangling ref doesn't fault | inline `match graph.index.get(from_name){Some=>..,None=>continue}` (mod.rs:280-287) — skip, not fault. **Correctly uses the tolerant inline path, NOT `parse_relations_json` (which faults on unknown)** | **PASS** `test_build_unknown_entity_relation_is_skipped` (1 ent, 0 rel) |
| LLM error | `_build_graph_worker` catches all → `fail_task` (graph_builder.py:188-191): error surfaced via task status, not swallowed | `llm.complete(...).await?` propagates `TeriError` (mod.rs:242,262) | **PASS** `test_build_propagates_llm_error` |

All 5 U-015 tests confirmed RUN (not filtered): `test result: ok. 35 passed; 0 failed`.

### Symbol rollup — U-015 (S-181..S-197)

Rule: a unit PASS needs every symbol `- [x]`/`- [≠]` (covered) or explicitly mapped-to-another-unit. Outcome: **17/17 accounted for — 0 dropped, 0 unmapped gaps.**

- **`- [x]` covered by `build()`:** **S-190** (`_build_graph_worker` → the create→ontology→split→batch→wait→info→complete worker) — its **extraction-pipeline essence** (2-pass entity→relation, dedup, unknown-skip, empty-tolerance, error-propagation) is verified above. Flipped `- [~]` → `- [x]`.
- **`- [≠]` intentional-divergence (Zep SaaS / not-applicable-to-in-process-petgraph), already adjudicated in symbol-map with rationale + rust-target mapping:** S-181..S-188, S-191, S-192, S-195, S-196, S-197 (GraphInfo type/fields/to_dict → `entity_count()`/`relation_count()`/`serialize_to_json()`; `__init__` → llm-as-generic-param; `create_graph`/`set_ontology`/`_get_graph_info`/`get_graph_data`/`delete_graph` → Zep SaaS calls with no in-process equivalent). These are owner-style explicit divergences, NOT silent drops.
- **Distributed to OTHER units (Zep-async mechanics not needed on synchronous petgraph), cited:**
  - **S-189** `build_graph_async` (background-thread → task_id) → task-management layer = **U-012 `TaskManager`** (`backend/app/models/task.py`, ledger Layer 2, still `- [ ]`). Marked `- [≠]` in symbol-map (task layer not yet ported; `build()` is async/caller-managed). **Not dropped — tracked at U-012.**
  - **S-193** `add_text_batches` (1s sleep between batches) + **S-194** `_wait_for_episodes` (poll processed=True / 600s timeout) → Zep episode-batching/async-processing mechanics; on in-process petgraph the LLM call is synchronously awaitable so there is no episode lifecycle. `- [≠]` with rationale. **Correctly not reimplemented.**
  - **split_text / chunking** (called from `_build_graph_worker` step 3) → owned by **U-013 `TextProcessor.split_text`** (`text_processor.py` → `teri::services::text_processor`, ledger Layer 3, still `- [ ]`). See chunking adjudication below.

### Chunking adjudication (CRITICAL no-downgrade check)

MiroFish `split_text_into_chunks(chunk_size=500, overlap=50)` (file_parser.py:161) chunks text **before Zep ingestion**; the ledger labels it "for Zep episode batching." `build()` extracts over the WHOLE doc.

- **Primary purpose = Zep-episode-size artifact** (fine to omit for in-process petgraph — there is no episode size limit).
- **BUT it also bounds per-call text size**, which on a local/real LLM is genuine context-overflow protection for large docs. So it is **not purely cosmetic.**
- **Ownership:** the chunking *logic* is a distinct unit — **U-013 `TextProcessor.split_text`** — which is **`- [ ]` not yet ported.** Chunking is therefore **DISTRIBUTED to U-013, not silently dropped from the port.**
- **Verdict:** does NOT block U-015 (the extraction-pipeline contract is fully met for in-scope doc sizes, and chunking was never a `build()`-internal behavior in the symbol contract — it was a sibling worker step). **It IS recorded as a `- [!]` extend-`build()` follow-up:** when U-013 lands, `build()` should chunk large docs (split → extract per chunk → merge, dedup across chunks) before LLM extraction, to avoid context overflow on big inputs. Tracked below.

### Gaps for next cycle (`- [!]`)

- **`- [!]` GAP-U015-1 (chunking, deferred to U-013):** `build()` extracts over the whole doc; large docs (> LLM context) will overflow. Resolution lands with **U-013** (`text_processor.split_text`) — at that point extend `build()` to chunk→extract-per-chunk→merge. NOT a U-015 blocker (sibling-worker behavior, owned elsewhere); flagged so it is not forgotten. No owner-approval needed (it is a real future behavior, correctly sequenced after its owning unit).

### Result

PASS. Every `build()` branch matches MiroFish's resilience contract; 17/17 U-015 symbols are covered (`- [x]`/`- [≠]`) or explicitly distributed to U-012/U-013 with citations; chunking adjudicated (distributed to U-013, `- [!]` follow-up logged); 156-test baseline intact. U-015 flips `- [x]`; S-190 flips `- [x]`; merge-ledger U-015 → `- [x]` (verified-in-teri).
